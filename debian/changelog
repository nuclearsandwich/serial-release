    Use CLOCK_MONOTONIC (Linux)/SYSTEM_CLOCK (OS X) to time select()
  * on OS X, use SYSTEM_CLOCK, not CALENDAR_CLOCK
    Analogously to using CLOCK_MONOTONIC on Linux to time events in favor of CLOCK_REALTIME, SYSTEM_CLOCK should be used in favor of CALENDAR_CLOCK on OS X.
    Ref: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11680461/monotonic-clock-on-osx
  * on Linux, use CLOCK_MONOTONIC for clock_gettime()
    On Linux systems which are being driven by an external time source (NTP or PTP), it is possible that time appears to slew in reverse under CLOCK_REALTIME. Since the timer function is used to time durations of events (calls to select()), it is better to use CLOCK_MONOTONIC, which isn't subject to slewing.

ros-kinetic-serial (1.2.1-0jessie) jessie; urgency=high

  * Removed the use of a C++11 feature for compatibility with older browsers.
  * Fixed an issue with cross compiling with mingw on Windows.
  * Restructured Visual Studio project layout.
  * Added include of ``#include <AvailabilityMacros.h>`` on OS X (listing of ports).
  * Fixed MXE for the listing of ports on Windows.
  * Now closes file device if ``reconfigureDevice`` fails (Windows).
  * Added the MARK/SPACE parity bit option, also made it optional.
    Adding the enumeration values for MARK and SPACE was the only code change to an API header.
    It should not affect ABI or API.
  * Added support for 576000 baud on Linux.
  * Now releases iterator properly in listing of ports code for OS X.
  * Fixed the ability to open COM ports over COM10 on Windows.
  * Fixed up some documentation about exceptions in ``serial.h``.

ros-kinetic-serial (1.2.0-0jessie) jessie; urgency=high

  * Fixed usage of scoped locks
    Previously they were getting destroyed immediately because they were not stored in a temporary scope variable
  * Added check of return value from close in Serial::SerialImpl::close () in unix.cc and win.cc
  * Added ability to enumerate ports on linux and windows.
    Updated serial_example.cc to show example of port enumeration.
  * Fixed compile on VS2013
  * Added functions ``waitReadable`` and ``waitByteTimes`` with implemenations for Unix to support high performance reading
